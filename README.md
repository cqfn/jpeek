jPeek is a static collector of Java code metrics.

**Motivation**:
[Class cohesion](http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2008_07/article1.pdf), for example,
is considered as one of most important object-oriented software attributes.
There are
[over 30](http://www.math.md/files/csjm/v25-n1/v25-n1-(pp44-74).pdf)
different cohesion metrics invented so far, but almost none of them
have calculators available. The situation with other metrics is very similar.
We want to create such a tool that will make it
possible to analyze code quality more or less formally (with hundreds of metrics). Then, we will
apply this analysis to different Java libraries with an intent to prove
that the ideas from [Elegant Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
book series make sense.

## How to use?

Load the latest `jar-with-dependencies.jar` file from
[here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jpeek/jpeek/)
and then:

```bash
java -jar jpeek-jar-with-dependencies.jar --sources . --target ./jpeek
```

jPeek will analyze Java files in the current directory.
XML reports will be generated in the `./jpeek` directory. Enjoy.

You can also deploy it as a web service to your own platform. Just compile it
with `mvn clean package --settings settings.xml` and then run, as `Procfile` suggests.
You will need to have `settings.xml` with the following data:

```xml
<settings>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>jpeek-heroku</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <sentry.dsn>https://...</sentry.dsn>
        <dynamo.key>AKIAI..........LNN6A</dynamo.key>
        <dynamo.secret>6560KMv5+8Ti....................Qdwob63Z</dynamo.secret>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>
```

You will also need these tables in DynamoDB (all indexes must deliver `ALL` attributes):

```
jpeek-mistakes:
  metric (HASH/String)
  version (RANGE/String)
  indexes:
    mistakes (GSI):
      version (HASH/String),
      avg (RANGE/Number)
jpeek-results:
  artifact (HASH/String)
  indexes:
    ranks (GSI):
      version (HASH/String)
      rank (RANGE/Number)
    scores (GSI):
      version (HASH/String)
      score (RANGE/Number)
    recent (GSI):
      good (HASH/String)
      added (RANGE/Number)
```

## How it works?

First, `Skeleton` parses Java bytecode using Javaassit and ASM, in order to produce
`skeleton.xml`. This XML document contains information about each class, which
is necessary for the metrics calculations. For example, this simple Java
class:

```java
class Book {
  private int id;
  int getId() {
    return this.id;
  }
}
```

Will look like this in the `skeleton.xml`:

```xml
<class id='Book'>
  <attributes>
   <attribute public='false' static='false' type='I'>id</attribute>
  </attributes>
  <methods>
    <method abstract='false' ctor='true' desc='()I' name='getId' public='true' static='false'>
      <return>I</return>
      <args/>
    </method>
  </methods>
</class>
```

Then, we have a collection of XSL stylesheets, one per each metric. For example,
`LCOM.xsl` transforms `skeleton.xml` into `LCOM.xml`, which may look like this:

```xml
<metric>
  <title>MMAC</title>
  <app>
    <class id='InstantiatorProvider' value='1'/>
    <class id='InstantationException' value='0'/>
    <class id='AnswersValidator' value='0.0583'/>
    <class id='ClassNode' value='0.25'/>
    [... skipped ...]
  </app>
</metric>
```

Thus, all calculations happen inside the XSLT files. We decided to implement
it this way after a less successful attempt to do it all in Java. It seems
that XSL is much more suitable for manipulations with data than Java.

### jPeek maven plugin
We are developing a jPeek plugin for Maven, see [jPeek Maven plugin](https://github.com/yegor256/jpeek-maven-plugin) project.

## Known Limitations

* The java compiler is known to inline constant variables as per [JLS 13.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-13.html#jls-13.1). This affects the results calculated by metrics that take into account access to class attributes if these are `final` constants. For instance, all LCOM and COM metrics are affected.
