jPeek is a static collector of Java code metrics.

**Motivation**:
[Class cohesion](http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2008_07/article1.pdf), for example,
is considered as one of most important object-oriented software attributes.
There are
[over 30](http://www.math.md/files/csjm/v25-n1/v25-n1-(pp44-74).pdf)
different cohesion metrics invented so far, but almost none of them
have calculators available. The situation with other metrics is very similar.
We want to create such a tool that will make it
possible to analyze code quality more or less formally (with hundreds of metrics). Then, we will
apply this analysis to different Java libraries with an intent to prove
that the ideas from [Elegant Objects](http://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
book series make sense.

## How to use?

Load [this JAR file](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jpeek/jpeek/0.3/jpeek-0.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar) and then:

```bash
$ java -jar jpeek-0.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar . ./jpeek
```

jPeek will analyze Java files in the current directory.
XML reports will be generated in the `./jpeek` directory. Enjoy.

## Cohesion Metrics

These papers provide a pretty good summary of cohesion metrics:
