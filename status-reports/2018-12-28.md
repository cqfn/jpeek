Release 0.27 (Metrics corrections)

Scope Status
* Metrics correction [30%]
* jpeek maven plugin [0%]
* jpeek CI server [0%]
* jpeek IntelliJ plugin [0%]

Issues:
* Lots of metrics correction tasks that must be fixed, so jpeek won't have any
 new feature soon.
* Project does not have REV members. Being a sandbox project cuts veteran
 members from taking part in project, but we don't have members with enough reputation to be revisors.
* A lot of project staff is on vacation.
* Project needs funding. Albeit we have some people working for free we still 
have a lot of developers with rate above $0.

Risks
* Jpeek have a lot of metrics correcting tasks, which scares newbies and ends 
up not being resolved [3/7]
