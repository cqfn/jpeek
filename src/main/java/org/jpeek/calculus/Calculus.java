/**
 * Metrics calculus interface.
 * @since 0.30.9
 * @todo #412:30min We start implementing LCOM4Calculus implementation. We should continue
 *  calculating real 'class@value' and 'class/vars/var[@id=pairs]/text' values and remove
 *  @Disabled annotation on all Lcom4CalculusTest class. If we choose to calculate LCOM4 with Java
 *  only we should also remove LCOM4.xsl part that is doing the calculus and let the xsl here just
 *  to build the structure of the xml result. This part is especially the one calculating
 *  "xsl:variable name='E'" L73->L89, and the one doing the division L97 -> L99
 * @todo #449:30min The `node` method in this interface was designed with only
 *  XSL implementation in mind - it uses the `metric` parameter to select the
 *  XSL file and uses that file to transform the `skeleton`. This makes Java
 *  based implementations a little awkward because the `metric` parameter
 *  becomes redundant: there is a Java implementation for each metric, and these
 *  implementations already know which metric they are for. The question becomes
 *  - how to select correct java implementation for a given metric and integrate
 *  it seamlessly with XSL calculus in `XslReport`. One option could be removing
 *  the `metric` parameter from the method and injecting a Calculus for a
 *  concrete metric in `XslReport` directly. Another could be implementing
 *  Chain Of Responsibility pattern. Decide on the best way to integrate Java
 *  based Calculus with XSL based Calculus in `XslReport` and implement it.
